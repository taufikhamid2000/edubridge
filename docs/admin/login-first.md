# Admin Access Fix: Emergency Manual Fix

The normal troubleshooting steps didn't work, so let's try a direct approach to fix your admin access:

## Direct Fix Using Bypass Authentication

When normal authentication fails, we can use the emergency bypass feature:

1. **Use the Direct Admin Assignment Tool**:

   - Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/make-admin
   - Enter your user ID (if you don't know your user ID, you can find it in your Supabase dashboard)
   - Add `?bypass=true` to the URL: http://localhost:3000/admin/make-admin?bypass=true
   - This special URL will enable the bypass option

2. **Add Bypass Code to Your Request**: - When using the admin tool with the bypass URL, check the "Bypass authentication" option that appears

   - Enter your user ID (from Supabase or from localStorage if you check your browser dev tools)
   - Click "Grant Admin Role"

3. **If You Don't Know Your User ID**:

   - Open your browser's developer tools (F12)
   - Go to the "Application" tab
   - Look under "Local Storage" for your site
   - Find an entry related to authentication (likely named "edubridge-auth-storage-key")
   - The user ID should be visible in the JSON data

4. **Try accessing the admin page again**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/users

## Alternate Direct Fix: Using the Database

If the above doesn't work, you can directly modify your database:

1. **Open your Supabase dashboard**
2. **Go to Table Editor and find the "user_roles" table**
3. **Add a row with your user ID and role="admin"**

## Why This Emergency Fix Works

When the normal authentication flow fails, these approaches work because:

1. **Bypass Authentication**: The `?bypass=true` parameter enables a special mode in the make-admin tool that skips all authentication checks and lets you directly assign admin privileges.

2. **Direct Database Access**: By modifying the database directly, you bypass all application logic and authentication flows.

This is an emergency solution when the standard authentication methods don't work properly. After completing these steps, your account should have admin privileges regardless of cookie or authentication issues.

## After Fixing Admin Access

Once you have admin access:

1. Check the admin dashboard functionality
2. Consider investigating the root cause of the authentication issues in:
   - Cookie handling
   - Session management
   - Authentication flow
