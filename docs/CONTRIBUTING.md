## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for feature development
- `feature/[feature-name]` - Feature branches
- `fix/[issue-number]` - Bug fix branches

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

Where `type` is one of:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or tools

### Code Style

- Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Write meaningful comments for complex logic
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code when possible

### Testing Requirements

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Documentation

- Update documentation for any changes to APIs or features
- Document complex functions and components
- Keep README and other docs up to date
- Include JSDoc comments for public functions

## Review Process

Pull requests require:

1. Passing all automated tests
2. Code review by at least one maintainer
3. Documentation updates if needed
4. No outstanding requested changes

## Getting Help

If you need help with the contribution process:

- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/example)
