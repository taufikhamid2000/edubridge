## Database Setup

The admin functionality relies on several database tables:

1. **user_roles** - Stores user role information
2. **site_config** - Stores site-wide configuration
3. **admin_logs** - Audit log of admin actions

## Access Control

The admin panel is protected by role-based access control:

- Only users with the 'admin' role can access the panel
- Certain actions may be restricted to specific admin roles
- All admin actions are logged for audit purposes

## Deployment

To set up the admin functionality:

1. Apply the database migration:

```
npm run db:migrate:admin
```

2. Create an initial admin user by running the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES ('YOUR_USER_UUID', 'admin');
```

## Best Practices

1. **Limit Admin Access** - Only grant admin privileges to trusted users
2. **Use Audit Logs** - Regularly review admin actions through logs
3. **Test Changes** - Always test configuration changes before deploying to production
4. **Regular Backups** - Ensure database backups before making significant changes
