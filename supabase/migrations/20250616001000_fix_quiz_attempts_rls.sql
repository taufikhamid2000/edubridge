-- Migration file to fix Row Level Security (RLS) for quiz_attempts table
-- This will resolve the issue where quiz attempts can't be saved

-- STEP 1: Check RLS status for quiz_attempts table
SELECT 
  n.nspname AS schema_name,
  c.relname AS table_name,
  CASE WHEN c.relrowsecurity THEN 'RLS enabled' ELSE 'RLS disabled' END AS rls_status
FROM pg_class c
JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
WHERE n.nspname = 'public' 
AND c.relkind = 'r' 
AND c.relname = 'quiz_attempts';

-- STEP 2: Drop problematic RLS policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Restrict quiz attempts access" ON public.quiz_attempts;

-- STEP 3: Ensure RLS is enabled (but with proper policies)
ALTER TABLE public.quiz_attempts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- STEP 4: Create policies that allow users to:
-- - Insert their own quiz attempts (anonymous or authenticated)
-- - Read only their own attempts (when authenticated)
-- - Admin can read all attempts

-- Allow inserting quiz attempts (required for the submission API)
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'quiz_attempts' AND policyname = 'Allow users to submit quiz attempts') THEN

END $$;

-- STEP 8: Check for other related tables that might need RLS fixes

-- Note: We previously had RLS fixes for quiz_attempt_answers here,
-- but that table doesn't exist in the database.
-- The migration now only targets tables that definitely exist:
-- 1. quiz_attempts
-- 2. school_stats_history

-- If you later create the quiz_attempt_answers table, you'll need 
-- appropriate RLS policies for that table too.

-- STEP 9: Emergency fix option - if the above doesn't work, this will definitely fix it
-- Uncomment the line below if you're still having issues after applying all policies

-- ALTER TABLE public.school_stats_history DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Note: Disabling RLS should be a last resort and temporary solution.
-- Once the application is working, proper RLS policies should be configured.
