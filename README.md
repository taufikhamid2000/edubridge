## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- Supabase account

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env.local`
2. Fill in your Supabase credentials:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon/public key
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Your Supabase service role key for admin operations (required for admin features)

For detailed environment setup instructions, see [Environment Setup Guide](./docs/environment-setup.md).

### Development Server

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Database Migrations

For database schema changes, we use Supabase migrations. Apply them as follows:

```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase migration up

# Or use our script
./scripts/apply_quiz_attempts_migration.sh
```

To fix the "quiz_attempts table not found" error, see the [Quiz Attempts Migration Guide](./docs/database/apply_quiz_attempts_migration.md).

For more details about database schema and management, see the [Database Documentation](./docs/database/).
npm run dev

````

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing components, hooks, utilities, and services. To run the tests:

```bash
npm test          # Run tests once
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
````

Tests are organized in the following structure:

- `src/__tests__/components/` - Component tests
- `src/__tests__/hooks/` - Hook tests
- `src/__tests__/lib/` - Utility function tests
- `src/__tests__/services/` - Service function tests

When adding new features, please add corresponding tests.

## Production Security

For production deployments, we've implemented several security measures:

- Removed all debugging endpoints and tools
- Implemented proper error logging through the logger service
- Added secure authentication validation for admin functions
- Applied the principle of least privilege for all database operations

See [Security Considerations](./docs/admin-panel.md#security-considerations) in the admin documentation for more details.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
