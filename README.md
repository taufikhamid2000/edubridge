This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, set up your environment variables:

1. Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`
2. Fill in your Supabase credentials:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon/public key
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: (Optional) Your Supabase service role key for admin operations

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Testing

This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing components, hooks, utilities, and services. To run the tests:

```bash
npm test          # Run tests once
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

Tests are organized in the following structure:

- `src/__tests__/components/` - Component tests
- `src/__tests__/hooks/` - Hook tests
- `src/__tests__/lib/` - Utility function tests
- `src/__tests__/services/` - Service function tests

When adding new features, please add corresponding tests.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
