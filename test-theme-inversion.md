# Theme Inversion Test Results

## Changes Made

1. **CSS Variables Updated** (`src/styles/globals.css`):

   - `:root` now has dark theme colors (bg: #121212, text: #e0e0e0)
   - `.dark` now has light theme colors (bg: #ffffff, text: #1a1a1a)

2. **Theme Logic Updated**:

   - `useTheme.ts`: Default theme set to 'light' (which displays as dark mode)
   - `theme.ts`: System fallback set to 'light' (which displays as dark mode)

3. **Automated Class Swapping**:

   - Used `scripts/invert-theme.sh` to swap ~115 files with Tailwind classes
   - Swapped patterns like `bg-white` â†” `bg-gray-800`, `text-black` â†” `text-white`, etc.
   - Classes like `bg-gray-800 dark:bg-white` now mean "dark by default, light on light mode"

4. **Manual Fixes Applied**:
   - Footer component styling
   - AchievementCard component
   - Dashboard components (Achievements, RecentActivity, SubjectSearch)
   - CSS hover states for header menu

## Expected Behavior

- **Default appearance**: Dark theme (gray/black backgrounds, light text)
- **Theme toggle**: Shows ðŸŒž (sun) icon to switch to light mode
- **Light mode appearance**: Light theme (white backgrounds, dark text)
- **Theme toggle in light mode**: Shows ðŸŒ™ (moon) icon to switch back to dark mode

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Application compiles without errors
- [x] Homepage loads with dark theme by default
- [x] Auth page uses inverted theme correctly
- [x] Dashboard page displays properly
- [x] Theme toggle icon shows correctly (ðŸŒž for light mode switch)
- [ ] Theme toggle functionality works (manual test needed)
- [ ] Local storage persistence works (manual test needed)
- [ ] All major components display consistently (manual test needed)

## Key Components Verified

- Header with theme toggle
- Footer with proper theming
- Dashboard components
- Auth page
- Achievement cards
- CSS variables for consistent theming

## Status: âœ… READY FOR TESTING

The theme inversion is complete. All code changes have been applied successfully, and the application compiles without errors. The next step is manual testing of the theme toggle functionality and visual consistency across all pages.
